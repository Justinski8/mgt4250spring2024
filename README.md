## Project description

### Project Goal
Our overarching goal during this project is to analyze the performance of Major League Baseballâ€™s top 50 highest-earning players when compared to their Wins Above Replacement (WAR) statistic. This offers a fascinating insight into the correlation between financial investment and on-field contribution. We can uncover whether hefty salaries align with higher-level performance or if there are disparities between compensation and actual impact on the game. This will show the efficiency of allocating resources in professional baseball.

* WAR = Wins Above Replacement - A metric that measures a player's value in all facets of the game by deciphering how many more "wins" he's worth over an "average player." EX) an average player would have a WAR of 0.0 *

## Questions of interest
#### Overarching Question
- What is the correlation between the top 50 highest paid MLB players and their on-field performance?

#### Sub Questions
1. How does WAR correlate to annual salary among the top 50 highest paid players?
2. How do teams and their largest contracts on payroll compare to one another?
3. Is a certain position group valued more than others based on the sum of their total contracts?
  
### Importance statement
These questions are *especially* **important** because ...
1. Reason 1
2. Reason 2
3. Reason 3
